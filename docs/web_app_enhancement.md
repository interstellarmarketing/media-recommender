# Web App Enhancement Specification

## Overview
I have a working web application that recommends TV shows and movies to users. Currently, there is only one main page with the recommendation system. I want to:
1. Update the overall look and feel to be professional and modern (inspired by [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/) or [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)).
2. Create a new page (or section) that displays a larger catalog of TV shows and movies (a few hundred items).
3. Include useful info for each title (recommendation status, ratings, where to watch, etc.).

## Design / Aesthetic Goals
- **Professional Look**: The UI should feel polished, clean, and visually appealing.
- **Modern Interface**: Clear typography, responsive design, and a consistent color palette.
- **Inspiration**: Draw ideas from JustWatch and Letterboxd for layout, card designs, icons, etc.

## Feature Requirements

### 1. New Catalog Page
- **Route**: Create a new route (e.g., `/catalog`) for browsing the full list of TV shows and movies.
- **Layout**:
  - Display items in a grid or card-based design.
  - Each card should include:
    - Poster image
    - Title
    - Recommendation badge (if recommended)
    - Rating (stars or numeric)
    - Watch providers (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.)
  - A search bar or filter options at the top to filter by:
    - Recommended vs. not recommended
    - Genre
    - Rating
    - Other relevant criteria
- **Pagination / Lazy Loading**: Implement a way to handle large datasets (hundreds of items) efficiently.

### 2. Data Display
- **Recommendation Status**: Clearly show if I recommend the title (badge, icon, or label).
- **Ratings**: Include either a star rating system or a numeric score.
- **Watch Providers**: Show the streaming service(s) or places where the title can be watched.
- **Additional Metadata**:
  - Genre, year, brief synopsis (if available)
  - Optionally, main cast or relevant tags

### 3. Optional Detail View
- On card click/tap, open a modal or direct the user to a detail page.
- Display deeper info:
  - Synopsis
  - Release year
  - Genre
  - Cast
  - Links to official site or trailers
- Provide a clear "Back" or "Close" function to return to the catalog.

### 4. Sharing Functionality
- **Share Button**: Allow users to share individual titles via a link, or copy a link to the clipboard.
- **Share List**: Optionally allow users to create/share a custom list of recommended titles in a single link.

### 5. Existing Recommendation Page
- Keep the main recommendation system at (e.g.) `/recommendations`.
- Apply the same updated styling to this page for consistency.
- Include a link or button to `/catalog` so users can discover more content.

## Implementation & Technical Details

- **Front-End**: 
  - If using React/Vue/Angular, break down UI into reusable components.
  - Consider using a modern CSS framework like Tailwind, Bootstrap, or Material UI.
  - Ensure responsiveness with CSS Grid or Flexbox.
- **Back-End**:
  - Provide a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/catalog`) to fetch the list of shows and movies if needed.
  - Consider a schema update to store:
    - Streaming providers
    - Ratings
    - Recommendation status
- **Performance**:
  - Use lazy loading of images.
  - Consider pagination or infinite scrolling for large lists.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Use descriptive alt text for images.
  - Proper ARIA labels for interactive elements.

## Code Quality & Best Practices
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Handle potential errors gracefully, such as failed API calls.
- Implement basic unit or integration tests if possible.

## End Result
By following these guidelines, the web application will have:
- A polished, user-friendly interface.
- Clear navigation between the recommendation system and the new catalog page.
- Convenient ways to view, filter, and share recommendations with friends.
